## Clone

This repository includes submodule. So if you want to clone it, you have to use the command bellow:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/vcavalca/42SP-Fract-ol.git
```
The simple clone command `git clone https://github.com/vcavalca/42SP-Fract-ol.git` , will not clone the content of the `libft` and `Minilibx-linux` folder.

## How it works

After cloning, use the `make` command to compile.

``` bash
make
```

To run the application use ./fractol + fractal you want from two available

``` bash
./fractol Julia
```

``` bash
./fractol Mandelbrot
```
