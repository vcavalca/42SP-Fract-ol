## Clone

This repository includes submodule. So if you want to clone it, you have to use the command bellow:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/vcavalca/42SP-Fract-ol.git
```
The simple clone command `git clone https://github.com/vcavalca/42SP-Fract-ol.git` , will not clone the content of the `libft` and `Minilibx-linux` folder.
